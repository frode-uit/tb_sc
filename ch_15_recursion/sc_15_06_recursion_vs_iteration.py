✓ Problem naturally divides into smaller versions of itself
  Examples: Tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms
  
✓ Code is cleaner and more elegant with recursion
  Examples: Tower of Hanoi, directory traversal
  
✓ Problem depth is reasonable (< 1000 levels in Python)
  Examples: Parsing expressions, backtracking algorithms
  
✓ Working with recursive data structures
  Examples: Trees, graphs, nested lists

Good use cases:
  • Tree/graph traversal
  • Divide and conquer (merge sort, quick sort)
  • Tower of Hanoi
  • Generating permutations/combinations
  • Parsing nested structures
  • Backtracking problems (sudoku, maze solving)

✓ Simple, straightforward loops
  Examples: Counting, summing, searching arrays
  
✓ Performance is critical
  Iteration has less overhead than recursion
  
✓ Problem depth could be very large
  No risk of stack overflow with iteration
  
✓ No natural recursive structure
  Examples: Processing a list sequentially

Good use cases:
  • Simple counting or accumulation
  • Array/list processing
  • Fibonacci sequence
  • Most mathematical sequences
  • File reading line by line
  • User input loops

✗ Forgetting the base case
  → Infinite recursion → Stack overflow
  
✗ Stack overflow with deep recursion
  → Python limit: ~1000 recursive calls
  → Solution: Use iteration or increase recursion limit (risky!)
  
✗ Inefficiency without memoization
  → Fibonacci is classic example: O(2^n) without memoization
  → Solution: Use iteration or memoization
  
✗ Harder to debug
  → Stack traces can be long and confusing
  → Solution: Print statements, or convert to iteration
  
✗ More memory overhead
  → Each recursive call uses stack space
  → Solution: Use iteration for large problems

Choose RECURSION when:
  • Problem is naturally recursive (trees, divide-and-conquer)
  • Code is much cleaner with recursion
  • Depth is small (< 1000 in Python)
  • Performance is not critical
  
Choose ITERATION when:
  • Simple sequential processing
  • Performance matters
  • Depth could be large
  • No natural recursive structure
  
When in doubt:
  1. Start with the clearest solution (often iteration)
  2. Only use recursion if it makes code significantly cleaner
  3. Profile if performance matters
  4. Remember: Readability counts!
