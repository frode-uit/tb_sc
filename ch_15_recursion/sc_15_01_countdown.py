RECURSION means a function calls itself to solve a problem.

Think of it as breaking a big problem into smaller pieces,
until the pieces are so small they can be solved directly.

Key components:
  1. BASE CASE - The simplest version that can be solved directly
  2. RECURSIVE CASE - The function calls itself with a simpler problem

Recursive version:
  • More elegant and self-descriptive
  • Uses the call stack
  • Can hit stack limit for large n
  
Iterative version:
  • More explicit about what's happening
  • Uses a loop variable
  • No stack limit concerns
  
For countdown, iteration is simpler and more efficient.
But recursion teaches the fundamental pattern!

1. Recursion = A function calling itself
2. Always need a BASE CASE to stop
3. Each recursive call should be SIMPLER
4. The call stack keeps track of all layers
5. Countdown is the simplest example to understand the pattern
